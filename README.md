Aqueduct Futures Website

This website was worked on during the summer of 2013 by myself and two other computer science students.
I was mainly in charge of the CSS and I wrote a majority of the javascript scripts and helped with the home page scripts. I also was the only person working on the mobile portion of the site.

Some of the php files have been removed for security reasons.

Pages I created:<br>
