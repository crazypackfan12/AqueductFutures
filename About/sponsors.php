			<h3>Benefits to Partnering with Education: <em>access to talent</em></h3>
			<ul>
			  <p>&bull;One of only six polytechnic universities nationwide, Cal Poly Pomona's &quot;learn by doing&quot; philosophy balances experimental design approaches with real-life application, and promotes hands-on learning, interdisciplinary practice and community involvement<br />
			  </p>
			  <p>&bull;Architecture's undergraduate and graduate programs are nationally ranked and listed among the top 15 U.S. Architecture Schools, according to Architect Magazine and DesignIntellegence<br />
			  </p>
			  <p>&bull;The Landscape Architecture program is extremely well respected and has won 9 national student awards in the last three years, more than any other L.A. program in the U.S.<br />
			  </p>
			  <p>&bull;Additional faculty expertise within the College of Environmental Design exists from multiple disciplines in sustainability education such as carbon-neutral building design, affordable housing, transit oriented development, alternative energy and green technologies<br />
			  </p>
			  <p>&bull;Cal Poly Pomona brings tremendous state-wide visibility as part of the 23-campus California State University (CSU) System and the Chancellor's Office - the nation's largest university system<br />
			</p></ul>
			<h3>Opportunities for Marketing and Publicity at Cal Poly Pomona</h3></p>
			<ul>  
			  <p>&bull;A story that should be told - At a time when the state of California is greatly hindering education with unprecedented budget cuts, student fee increases, class reductions, and program eliminations, a partnership with Metabolic Studios would demonstrate a strong commitment to supporting higher education and would create truly unique opportunities for future generations of designers<br />
				</p>
			  <p>&bull;Sponsors  have opportunities for feature articles in campus publications and electronic media with regular distribution to more than 110,000+ alumni, friends and donors to the university<br />
				</p>
			  <p>&bull;VIP placement in our annual Honor Roll and Report of Donors<br />
				</p>
			  <p>&bull;Premier sponsorship access for the Southern California Tasting &amp; Auction held each spring at Cal Poly Pomona with close to 1,000 visitors in attendance</p>
