		<h3>Meredith McKenzie (Adjunct Assistant Professor, City and Regional Planning)</h3>

		Meredith McKenzie, JD, is a recognized California water policy expert, has been a faculty member at Cal Poly Pomona in the Urban & Regional Planning Department since 2008, where she teaches graduate and undergraduate students in environmental planning and the California Water course.  She also serves as a faculty representative to the university-wide 'water initiative' planning group.

		As a consultant, McKenzie directs water-related projects for such clients as the City of Pasadena, Arroyo Seco Foundation, and Friends of the Los Angeles River, and serves on numerous committees, including the Upper Los Angeles River Integrated Regional Water Management Steering Committee and the Los Angeles Dept of Water & Power Recycled Water Advisory Group.

		<h3>Andrew Kanzler (Adjunct Assistant Professor, Landscape Architecture)</h3>

		Andrew Kanzleris a graduate of Cal Poly's MLA program, who has a background in graphic design where he spent many years developing his understanding of data visualization and graphic semiotics. He has since been in the field of landscape architecture and planning focusing primarily on water and food systems. His added background in regenerative studies gives him the unique ability to create complex systems and have them understood implicitly/experientially.

		Andrew is intimately involved with communities in the Inland Empire that focus on food security and has written plant guides for edible landscaping in Mediterranean climates. Andrew is currently employed with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency where he focuses on water resources, conservation, and public education.

		<h3>Jonathan Linkus (guest instructor)</h3>

		Jonathan C. Linkus is a practicing urban designer with an innate passion and curiosity  about the peri-urban ecological pressures facing Eastern California developed while growing up in the region.

		Linkus' thesis for Master of Architecture in Urban Design at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, scored human activity and development according to inter-regional ecological dynamics along the Los Angeles Aqueduct. His research continues to embody a new infrastructural repertoire for the planning and landscape professions; most recently, SolarLink  proved the potential for California's Aqueducts to become a renewable energy corridors and was included in the Drylands Design exhibition in Los Angeles.

		Jonathan is currently a member of the planning & urban design team at RTKL in Los Angeles, focusing on transit-oriented developments and large-scale master planning.

		<h3>Dean Michael Woo (College of Environmental Design)</h3>

		Michael Woo brings a unique background in public service, community involvement, and urban planning to his role as Dean of the College of Environmental Design.  He was the first trained urban planner and the first Asian American elected to serve on the Los Angeles City Council.  Representing a diverse constituency of 235,000 people in Hollywood and surrounding neighborhoods, Dean Woo spearheaded the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, which laid the groundwork for Hollywood's current revitalization; played a key role in choosing the route and station locations of the Metro Red Line subway; and made decisions on numerous development proposals and neighborhood controversies.  He gave up his Council seat after eight years to become one of 24 candidates for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1993, ultimately receiving 46 percent of the citywide vote and a second-place finish in the citywide run-off election.

		In 2005, Dean Woo was appointed to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission.  He chairs the national board of directors of Smart Growth America, the national coalition advocating compact development patterns and sustainable transportation choices; the governing board of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center; and the board of directors of Sustainable Economic Enterprises of Los Angeles (SEE-LA), the nonprofit organization which runs the Hollywood Farmers Market, the largest certified farmers market in the City of Los Angeles, which he helped to establish 19 years ago when he was a Councilman.

		Reflecting his growing interest in the relationship between climate change and environmental design, Woo's recent special assignments include an appointment from the California Air Resources Board to the Regional Targets Advisory Committee (RTAC), and an invitation from the Urban Land Institute to co-chair a study panel on the economic impacts of Senate Bill 375.

		Dean Woo is the coordinator of the Cal Poly Pomona Water Initiative. In this role, he will be participating in the Aqueduct Centennial courses and advising the project.

		<h3>Weimin Li, PhD (Assistant Professor, Landscape Architecture, Project's GIS Consultant)</h3>

		Professor Li's teaching and research are centered on applying state of the art geo-spatial technologies in investigating the interplay between natural and human systems in urban context and thus enriching the knowledge base of landscape design and environmental planning.  She integrates both ecological determinism and social/behavioral theories to support decision making in design and planning process.  Her current research emphasizes on the relationship between environmental amenities, e.g., urban green settings, and different dimensions of quality of life, e.g., safety (crime), health, and environmental justice, as well as how geospatial technologies can play critical role in such investigations.

		<h3>Andrew Kanzler (Adjunct Instructor)</h3>

		Andrew Kanzler began with a background in graphic design where he spent many years developing his understanding of data visualization and graphic semiotics. He has since been in the field of landscape architecture and planning focusing primarily on water and food systems.

		<h3>Jonathan Linkus (Guest Instructor)</h3>

		Jonthan Linkus grew up on the road between family fragments in Northern Nevada and Orange County, California which instilled him with an innate passion and curiosity for the  American West of Eastern California. His early interest in the way infrastructure unintentionally creates a sense of place at an inter-regional scale across subtle thresholds in the California hinterland.  His undergraduate study of art and engineering focused on the sustainable potential of  mid-century modern architecture. For his Master of Architecture in Urban Design (Harvard), his thesis focused on the Los Angeles Aqueduct with a creative solution to very complex sites and intractable scenarios. Linkus is currently a project manager at RTKL.

		<h3>Jeff Marshall, PhD (Director of Undergraduate Research, Professor Geological Sciences)</h3>

		A geomorphologist with expertise in river dynamics, watershed restoration, coastal processes, and geologic hazards.  He is fascinated by the energetic processes that shape the Earth's surface and the role of water in this process.  Dr. Marshall serves as Cal Poly Coordinator for Undergraduate Research and has substantial experience supervising student fieldwork.  His contributions to the Aqueduct Centennial Project include running field trips to significant sites, as well as teaching about restoration of Owens Valley and Mono Basin watersheds.

		<h3>Terence Young, PhD (Professor, Geography and Anthropology)</h3>

		A historical geographer of the environment with a focus on protected areas.  His research focuses on the connections between meaning, design, use and impacts of parks, forests, etc. by recreationists and tourists.  Prof. Young brings his extensive experience and successful leadership with interdisciplinary symposiums to the project, and will be responsible for outreach and fundraising.  Dr. Young's expertise in recreation and parks will provide insights into existing protected areas as well as for developing a future vision for the Owens Valley and the route of the Aqueduct as a recreational amenity.
